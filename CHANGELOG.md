# Changelog

## v1.2

### Features

* Bots will sometimes nod, shake their head, and look players up and down when approached.

* Bots care about personal space and will get upset if you stay too close for too long. Builds some suspicion every 5 seconds if you're too close.

* **TTT2** Survivalist support. Survivalist bots will buy same (default) store items as if they were a detective.

* Bots can purchase UMP prototype and utilize it properly.

* **TTT2** Bots can use defibs to revive their allies. [This addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2115944312) is required for this to happen.

* Bots can push you away with crowbars if you get too close. Some bots will do this much more often than others.

* Bots will avoid ladders with people on them, assuming there is another reasonable route available

* Bots will back away from people that are trying to melee them

* Bots will reload outside of combat more often, and reload when they can't see their enemy.

### Changes/Rebalances

* Bots will be less likely to target the head or strafe on lower difficulties.

* Placed cvars on shared realm, so clients can see them.

* Rebalanced bot inventory management. Bots will prioritize special weapons (e.g. UMP prototype) over normal weapons.

* Overall bot accuracy rebalance:
  1. Worse accuracy when the bot is moving.
  2. Worse accuracy when their target is moving.
  3. Worse accuracy when the bot or its target is in smoke.
  4. Better accuracy when the bot is stationary.
  5. Better accuracy when shoothing stationary targets.
  6. Focus system like CSGO bots, where they will increase in shooting accuracy when shooting at the same target over time. Affected heavily by personality.

* Decreased time between quote management updates (2.5s -> 1s)

* **TTT2** Improved behavior consistency between custom roles by unifying behavior trees (i.e., clumped together common sequences into priority nodes)

* Bots won't be repelled from one another when at a health station

### Fixed

* Retrying bug that threw errors on SRCDS servers. (#34)

* Bots trying to break unbreakable obstructions. (#33)

* Bot inaccuracy not correctly scaling over distances. It was hard-capped to a lower value than it should be.

* Sending too many net msgs to syncronize bot avatars. (reported per @EntranceJew)

* Bots will place their crosshair closer to the stomach when they lose sight of their enemy.

* No longer EthicalNotify if there are no bots in the game.

* Bots with a melee will no longer slow themselves down by stafing while approaching.

* **TTT2** Jackal will start fights to prevent stalling rounds.

### Developer Notes

This is a more technical explanation of the changes in this version, and contains useful change info for developers.

* Refactored locomotor-related code to be neater and use Player:BotLocomotor instead of grabbing bot.components.locomotor every time.

* Reworked the behavior tree for modularity and consistency. You can nest priority nodes (tables sorted by numbers) inside of other priority nodes, allowing behaviors to be neatly grouped together. This improves consistency between role behaviors.

* Buyables now test for mod presence before attempting to buy a weapon. There is also the option to define if a weapon is TTT2 specific, but this is optional.

* Added easier support for setting temporary variables in the Memory component.

* Locomotor now supports +attack2 for right click actions.
