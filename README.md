## What is this?

This is a player bot addon for the Trouble in Terrorist Town game mode in Garry's Mod.

It is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing easy customization and expansion. It is designed for TTT2 while being fully playable in regular TTT.

📝 Note: Please stick to the main branch. Most other branches are eitherunstable or significantly behind.

## Maps

You can find the maps custom-made for this add-on [here](https://www.github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2-Maps).

**The bots will work on any map with a navmesh**, but if you want plug-and-play and/or you don't care, you can just use the above add-on.

## How to use

1. Download the latest version from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1256344426).
2. Start a Peer-to-Peer or SRCDS with sufficient player slots on a map with a navmesh or one of the included maps.
3. *As a super admin,* either type `!botadd X` in chat or write `ttt_bot_add X` in the console.
4. You're done!

## Role Support

This add-on supports a wide range of TTT2 roles. Here are some that have explicit compatibility:

* Jester
* Jackal
* Sidekick
* Hitman (needs work)
* Serial Killer
* Survivalist
* Bodyguard

The mod also auto-generates compatibility with custom roles, but it is imperfect. It does not comprehend most 'public killer' roles (e.g., 'Speedrunner').

## Usage and Commands

A basic usage guide can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2/wiki/Basic-Usage-Guide).

It will give you all the info you need for 90% of cases. A more in-depth set of guides are a WIP.

## For developers

[Check out the developer guide](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2/wiki/Developer-Guide).

Please help me document/improve the codebase! I would highly appreciate it. And you can have bots get named after you!
